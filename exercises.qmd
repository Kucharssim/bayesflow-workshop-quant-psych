### Normalizing flow

- Peek online: [here](./exercises/normalizing-flow.ipynb){target="_blank"}
- Download notebook: [here](./exercises/normalizing-flow.ipynb){download="normalizing-flow.ipynb"}

In this exercise, you will build a normalizing flow based on affine coupling from scratch using `keras`, that will learn to transform the [moons distribution](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html) into a standard normal.

### Flow matching - Datasaurus

- Peek online: [here](./exercises/flow-matching-datasaurus.ipynb){target="_blank"}.
- Download notebook: [here](./exercises/flow-matching-datasaurus.ipynb){download="flow-matching-datasaurus.ipynb"}.
- Download data: [here](./data/datasaurus.csv){download="datasaurus.csv"}

In this exercise, you will build a flow matching model using `keras` that transports a standard normal distribution into a distribution based on the [datasaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datasaurus_dozen).

### Flow matching - mirroring the Swiss roll

- Peek online: [here](./exercises/flow-matching-swiss-roll.ipynb){target="_blank"}.
- Download notebook: [here](./exercises/flow-matching-swiss-roll.ipynb){download="flow-matching-swiss-roll.ipynb"}.

In this exercise, you will expand the flow matching model so that you can condition the distribution on contextual variables. This will enable you to learn a flow that transports a doghnut distribution into the [swiss roll distribution](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_swiss_roll.html), mirrored along horizontal and vertical axes, depending on the context.

## BayesFlow

The BayesFlow project comes with a couple of example notebooks that can help you started with BayesFlow. In addition, below are two exercise notebooks you can use to familiarize yourself with BayesFlow.

### Estimating the mean and variance of a gaussian variable

- Peek online: [here](./exercises/bayesflow-normal.ipynb){target="_blank"}.
- Download notebook: [here](./exercises/bayesflow-normal.ipynb){download="bayesflow-normal.ipynb"}.

This notebook provides you with the very basics of the BayesFlow workflow - starting with defining simulators, through defining and training the neural approximators, and ending with network validation and inference.

### Diffusion decision model
